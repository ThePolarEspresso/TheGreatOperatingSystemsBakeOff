## CIS 452 Operating System Concepts Final Project Template

Group Members: Cymbre Spoehr, Anna Carvalho

Group Number (Blackboard): Group 1

Project Type (Presentation/Programming/Embedded): Programming Project

Project Description: We are wanting to create a program that simulates multiple bakers baking
different recipes in the same kitchen. We plan to use shared memory to simulate shared
ingredients and equipment used by the bakers, who will be represented by different processes.
In addition, we will simulate tasks that can be done without the bakerâ€™s direct supervision with
threads. For example, a single baker can use one stand mixer at a time, but they could do
something else while it is actually mixing. We plan to have several preset recipes that the user
can choose as parameters to the program.
